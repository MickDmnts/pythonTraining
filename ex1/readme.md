# Description

In a hypothetical zombie apocalypse, in the city of Athens, we know that 25000 people mutate from the virus every day. We also know that in 100 days the entire population will have mutated.

* Find the total population of the city.
* After 28 days, a battle begins between mutants and healthy people.
* How many people have mutated in 28 days?
* Compare the number of mutants and healthy ones and find out who will win the battle if they fight each other.
* If on day 28 we found the antidote and distributed it to 20,000 infected people per day, in how many days would the virus have been eradicated?
* To create a program in pseudocode form that will accept the appropriate data and answer the above questions.
